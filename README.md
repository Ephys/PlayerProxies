### Universal Interface

An overpowered wireless interface (like the transvector interface from Thaumic Tinkerer) which can be linked to almost anything that has an inventory.
If officially supports the following:

- Any IInventory.
- Any IFluidHandler.
- Players (works if the player is offline).
- Ender Chests (place one above the interface and link a player to it, works if the player is offline).
- Item Frames.
- [Jukeboxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QA4jiS7jzI) (they're not IInventories).
- Minecarts containers (chest & hopper in vanilla).
- Minecart furnaces.

Support for more can be added by other mods through IMC.  
Support for Cauldrons (as IFluidHandlers), flower pots, and Armor Stands is planned.

### Fluid Hopper

A hopper, for fluids. It

- Drains fluid blocks placed above it
- Drains tanks placed above it (entities & blocks)
- Fills tanks it points to (entities & blocks. Time to make a minecart tank!)

### Proximity Sensor

Emit a redstone signal when an entity (filtrable) is withing a set radius of the block.

### Fluid Diffuser

Applies the effects of fluids to nearby players.

- Piping potions will apply the potion effect.
- Piping fluids will apply the fluid effect.

### Handheld Fluid Diffuser

Same as the fluid diffuser but using fluid tanks and potions present in the inventory.

It will not use instant potions (like instant health) nor splash or lingering potions.
